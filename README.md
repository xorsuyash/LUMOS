# LUMOS ðŸª„

LUMOS is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based project designed to help college students. Leveraging the LLAMA 2 language model, LUMOS provides a conversational interface for students to ask syllabus-related questions and receive concise, syllabus-focused answers.

## Key Features

- **Syllabus-Focused Answering:** LUMOS's core strength is providing answers directly aligned with the queried syllabus. This sets it apart from general-purpose search engines.

- **Comprehensive Dataset:** It has been trained on scraped datasets from GFG and from some authentic textbooks.
